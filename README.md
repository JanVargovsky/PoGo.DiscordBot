# Discord Bot for players of the Pokemon Go
Discord BOT focused on internal communication within players of the Pokemon Go

- Set team & level as role
- Plan a raid
  - Set raid boss, location and scheduled time. React with üëç that you will attend and raid poll message will refresh itself
  - In case that amount of players is too high, it will split up players per team so you can create multiple raid lobbies for extra balls.
  - Do you have two devices or somebody is not on the Discord yet? You can add 1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£ etc.

\* is required.

2 - Just an alias for the logging purpose. Bot can run on multiple servers at once.  
3\* - Id of your Guild (Discord server).  
4\* - Name of the destination channel where the bot will write a raid polls.

Notes: In case you have multiple channels, the order is from the top to the bottom, so first matched will win and therefore place "*" as the last one.
